# Media Prima Dailymotion PHP HLS Redirector

This is the docker version of [tonton_dailymotion_php](https://github.com/samleong123/tonton_dailymotion_php) which is deprecated because of Dailymotion implementing [IP bind on their API](https://github.com/samleong123/tonton_dailymotion_php/issues/10#issuecomment-1288040891)

2. Terminal Access

### Steps :

2. Run a container with the image , the default port was set as 45172 to prevent port conflict

3. Head over to ```http://localhost:45172/``` and it should show out the web page
